# ContosoCrafts - DaprCon Demo

This sample shows a more in-depth setup for integrating Dapr into an existing application. It includes a variety of [#Infrastructure-Components], and also uses docker-compose to orchestrate every thing locally.

## Requirements

You'll need to have the follow installed to properly run the demo.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Spinning up the environment

First, spin up the supporting [#Infrastructure-Components]. Run these commands in the demo2 root directory.

```bash
> docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d
```

> A temporary folder named **contoso_temp** will be created in the root directory of the project as a storage location for these components.

Next, launch the application containers and sidecars.

```bash
> docker-compose up -d
```
