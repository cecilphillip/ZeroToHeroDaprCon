# Zero to Hero with Dapr - DaprCon Demos

This repo contains the demos I showed off at [DaprCon 2021](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/10/05/join-us-for-daprcon-october-19th-20th-2021/) during my Zero to Hero with Dapr session 👨🏽‍💻. Join the discussion for this session and others from DaprCon over on [Discord](https://aka.ms/dapr-discord).

## Start here

Before you dive into the demos, I recommend that you check out the getting started guide on the [Dapr documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/). It will walk you through getting Dapr setup on your machine.
